# CookbookLLM
Capstone project for Fall 2024. Uses a SLM to generate instructions to complete a requested recipe, so an unknowing or unskilled user can follow and complete them. Credit to alexredna on Hugging Face for the model used.

To use the application, start by downloading the latest version of Ollama. Then, using the Ollama terminal, enter this command: ollama run hf.co/RichardErkhov/alexredna_-_TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-reasoning-v2-gguf:Q4_K

Then, use the steps in the code file to download dependancies and libraries. Finally, the last cell available to run will start up the application, and you will be able to progress as expected.
